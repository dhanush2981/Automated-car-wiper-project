# Automated-car-wiper-project
An automated car wiper IoT project using Arduino is a fascinating endeavor that merges hardware and software to create a smart vehicle accessory. In this project, you use an Arduino microcontroller, which serves as the project's brain, to automate the operation of car wipers based on weather conditions.

The core component of this system is a rain sensor. This sensor is capable of detecting water on the car's windshield, signaling the presence of rain. When the sensor picks up on the moisture, it sends a signal to the Arduino.

Upon receiving this signal, the Arduino, which you have pre-programmed with specific instructions, reacts by activating the car's wiper system. The clever part of this programming is that you can set different responses depending on the amount of rain detected; for example, a light drizzle might trigger slow wiper movement, whereas a heavy downpour could cause the wipers to move more rapidly.
